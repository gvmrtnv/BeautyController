# BeautyController
One of my technique projects with use of SwiftUI, Combine, UIKit. Published to AppStore

The logic of the app is pretty simple. The user loads a photo of a person, can apply some filters, and run a check. 
The App sends a request to compliment generating service and creates a card with the user's photo and a comment, which is supposed to be lovely or funny. 
The user can save, share and watch a history of this cards. 

Extra information:
The architecture pattern is MVVM, as the most natural for SwiftUI.
